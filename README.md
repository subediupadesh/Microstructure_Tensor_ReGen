Figure_4_c_data.csv: This file contains the data of  Fig. 4(c) which is the result of the microstructure reconstruction after Tucker decomposition with 10 % sparsification for t = 1 h 23 min 20s. The spatial distribution of Cr composition is sufficient to represent the microstructural information for the binary Ti-Cr alloy. That is the data  of spatial coordinates and mole fraction of Cr at each coordinate is sufficient to represent this microstructure. Thus, the csv file consists of the following three columns : X-Coordinate (nm), Y-Coordinate (nm) and Cr_MoleFraction.  The unit for the values of X and Y coordinates is nm. The mole fraction is unitless.
